                The TurboGrafx-16, known as the PC Engine in Japan and France, is a fourth-generation home video game console designed by Hudson Soft and sold by NEC Home Electronics. 
                It was the first console marketed in the 16-bit era, although in reality it used a modified 8-bit CPU. It was released in Japan in 1987 and in North America in 1989.

                The Japanese model was imported and distributed in France in 1989, and the United Kingdom and Spain received a version based on the American model known as simply TurboGrafx. 
                In Japan, the system was launched as a competitor to the Famicom, but the delayed United States release meant that it ended up competing with the Sega Genesis and later the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.

                The Sega Genesis, known as the Mega Drive outside North America, is a 16-bit fourth-generation home video game console developed and sold by Sega. 
                The Genesis is Sega's third console and the successor to the Master System. Sega released it as the Mega Drive in Japan in 1988, 
                and later as the Genesis in North America in 1989.

            <p>
                In 1990, it was distributed as the Mega Drive by Virgin Mastertronic in Europe, 
                Ozisoft in Australasia, and Tec Toy in Brazil. In South Korea, it was distributed by Samsung as the Super GameBoy and later the Super Aladdin Boy.

                It was originally launched as a rental console for video game stores in Japan (called Neo Geo Rental System), 
                with its high price causing SNK not to release it for home use. This was later reversed due to high demand and it came into the market as a luxury console.

                The AES had the same raw specs as the MVS and had full compatibility, thus managed to bring a true arcade experience to home users. 
                The Neo Geo was revived along with the brand overall in December 2012 through the introduction of the Neo Geo X handheld and home system.
