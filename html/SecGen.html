                The Fairchild Channel F, short for "Channel Fun", was the first programmable ROM cartridgeâ€“based video game console, 
                and the first console to use a microprocessor. It was released by Fairchild Semiconductor in November 1976 across North America.

                It was originally named "Video Entertainment System", but when Atari, Inc. released its Video Computer System the next year, 
                Fairchild changed the name for its machine, although they continued to use the old name alongside it. By 1977, 
                the Fairchild Channel F had sold about 250,000 units, trailing behind sales of the VCS. In 1983, the production of the system was discontinued.

                The Atari 2600, originally branded as the Atari Video Computer System (Atari VCS) until November 1982, is a home video game console developed and produced by Atari
                Inc. Released on September 11, 1977. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It is credited with popularizing the use of microprocessor-based hardware and games stored on ROM cartridges 
                (a format first used with the Fairchild Channel F in 1976). The VCS was bundled with two joystick controllers, a conjoined pair of paddle controllers, 
                and a game cartridge: initially Combat, and later Pac-Man.

                The Intellivision is a home video game console released by Mattel Electronics in 1979. The name Intellivision is a portmanteau of "intelligent television". 
                Development of the console began in 1977, the same year as the introduction of its main competitor, the Atari 2600.Games development started in 1978 and continued until 1990 when the Intellivision was discontinued.

                From 1980 to 1983 over 3 million Intellivision units were sold. In 2009, video game website IGN named the Intellivision the No. 14 greatest video game console of all time. 
                It remained Mattel's only video game console until the release of the HyperScan in 2006.
