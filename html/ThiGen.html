                The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) is an 8-bit third-generation home video game console produced by Nintendo. 
                Nintendo first released it in Japan as the Family Computer, commonly known as the Famicom, in 1983.

                The NES featured a number of groundbreaking games,
                such as the platform game Super Mario Bros, the action-adventure game The Legend of Zelda and the action game Metroid. 
                Nintendo introduced a now-standard business model of licensing third-party developers to produce and distribute games for the NES.

                The Sega Master System is a third-generation 8-bit home video game console manufactured by Sega.
                It was originally a remodeled export version of the Sega Mark III, the third iteration of the SG-1000 series of consoles, 
                which was released in Japan in 1985 and featured enhanced graphical capabilities over its predecessors. 
                The Master System launched in North America in 1986, followed by Europe in 1987, and Brazil in 1989. 
                
            </p>
            <p>
                A Japanese version of the Master System was also launched in 1987, which features a few enhancements over the export models: 
                a built-in FM audio chip, a rapid-fire switch, and a dedicated port for the 3D glasses. The Master System II, a cheaper model, 
                was released in 1990 in North America and Europe. The original Master System models use both cartridges and a credit card-sized format known as Sega Cards. 
                Accessories for the consoles include a light gun and 3D glasses that work with a range of specially designed games.

                It is able to run almost all Atari 2600 cartridges, making it the first console with built-in backward compatibility. 
                It shipped with a different model of joystick from the 2600-standard CX40 and Pole Position II as the pack-in game.
