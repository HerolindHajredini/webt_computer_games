                The Xbox 360 is a home video game console developed by Microsoft. As the successor to the original Xbox, 
                it is the second console in the Xbox series. It competed with Sony's PlayStation 3 and Nintendo's Wii as part of the seventh generation of video game consoles. 
                It was officially unveiled on MTV on May 12, 2005, with detailed launch and game information announced later that month at the 2005 Electronic Entertainment Expo.

                The Xbox 360 features an online service, Xbox Live, which was expanded from its previous iteration on the original Xbox and received regular updates during the console's lifetime. 
                Available in free and subscription-based varieties, Xbox Live allows users to: play games online; 
                download games (through Xbox Live Arcade) and game demos; purchase and stream music, television programs, 
                and films through the Xbox Music and Xbox Video portals; and access third-party content services through media streaming applications.

                The PlayStation 3 (PS3) is a home video game console developed by Sony Computer Entertainment. 
                It is the successor to PlayStation 2, and is part of the PlayStation brand of consoles. 
                It was first released on November 11, 2006 in Japan, November 17, 2006 in North America, and March 23, 2007 in Europe and Australia. 
                The PlayStation 3 competed primarily against Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Nintendo's Wii as part of the seventh generation of video game consoles.
                The console was first officially announced at E3 2005, and was released at the end of 2006. It was the first console to use Blu-ray Disc as its primary storage medium.

                The console was the first PlayStation to integrate social gaming services, including the PlayStation Network, as well as the first to be controllable from a handheld console, 
                through its remote connectivity with PlayStation Portable and PlayStation Vita. In September 2009, the Slim model of the PlayStation 3 was released. 
                It no longer provided the hardware ability to run PS2 games. It was lighter and thinner than the original version, and featured a redesigned logo and marketing design, as well as a minor start-up change in software. 
                A Super Slim variation was then released in late 2012, further refining and redesigning the console.

                The Wii is a home video game console released by Nintendo on November 19, 2006. It is Nintendo's fifth major home video game console, 
                following the Nintendo GameCube, and is considered a seventh generation home console alongside Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Sony's PlayStation 3.
                The GameCube had fallen behind in sales compared to previous console offerings from Microsoft and Sony.

                Around 2003, Nintendo president Satoru Iwata made the decision for the company's next console to focus less on computational and graphics power and instead reinventing the console's interface to target a broader demographic of players, 
                using the codename Revolution for this new console as he believed it would spark a gaming revolution. 
                Nintendo created the Wii with its wireless Wii Remote controller that uses a combination of various motion sensing technologies and traditional controller features. 
                The Wii Remote could be used as a pointing device or as a means to detect motion of the player's arm or body, 
                creating new types of gameplay mechanics for the system.
