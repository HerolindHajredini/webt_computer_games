            <p>The Magnavox Odyssey is the first commercial home video game console. The hardware was designed by a small team led by Ralph H.
                Baer at Sanders Associates, while Magnavox completed development and released it in the United States in September 1972 and overseas the following year.

                The Odyssey consists of a white, black, and brown box that connects to a television set, and two rectangular controllers attached by wires. 
                It is capable of displaying three square dots and one line of varying height on the screen in monochrome black and white, with differing behavior for the dots depending on the game played. 
                Players place plastic overlays on the screen to display additional visual elements for each game, and the one or two players for each game control their dots with the knobs and buttons on the controller in accordance with the rules given for the game. 
                The console cannot generate audio or track scores. The Odyssey console came packaged with dice, paper money, and other board game paraphernalia to accompany the games, while a peripheral controller—the first video game light gun—was sold separately.

                The Coleco Telstar brand is a series of dedicated first-generation home video game consoles produced, released and marketed by Coleco from 1976 to 1978. 
                
            </p>
            <p>
                Starting with Coleco Telstar Pong clone based video game console on General Instrument's AY-3-8500 chip in 1976, there were 14 consoles released in the Coleco Telstar series. 
                About one million units of the first model called Coleco Telstar were sold.
                The large product lineup and the impending fading out of the Pong machines led Coleco to face near-bankruptcy in 1980.

            <p>
                Originally called TV Game Unit #7, it became far better known by its nickname, “The Brown Box.” 
                The name comes from the brown wood-grain, self-adhesive vinyl used to make the prototype look more attractive to potential investors. 
                
                
            </p>
            <p>
                The "Brown Box," though only a prototype, had basic features that most video games consoles still have today: two controls and a multigame program system.
                The "Brown Box" could be programmed to play a variety of games by flipping the switches along the front of the unit, as can be seen in the picture. 
                Program cards were used to show which switches needed to be set for specific games. "Brown Box" games included ping-pong, checkers, four different sports games, 
                target shooting with the use of a lightgun and a golf putting game, which required the use of a special attachment. Sanders licensed the "Brown Box" to Magnavox, 
                which released the system as the Magnavox Odyssey in 1972
