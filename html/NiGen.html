                The Xbox Series X and Series S are home video game consoles developed by Microsoft. 
                They were both released on November 10, 2020 as the fourth generation of the Xbox console family, succeeding the Xbox One family.
                Rumors regarding the consoles first emerged in early 2019, with the line as a whole codenamed "Scarlett", 
                and consisting of high-end and low-end models codenamed "Anaconda" and "Lockhart" respectively. 
                The high-end model was first teased during E3 2019 under the title "Project Scarlett", 
                while its name and design as Xbox Series X was unveiled during The Game Awards later in December. 
                In September 2020, Microsoft unveiled the low-end model as Xbox Series S.

                Microsoft is prioritizing hardware performance, including support for higher display resolutions (up to 8K resolution) along with high frame rates, 
                real-time ray tracing, and use of a high-speed solid-state drive to reduce loading times, on the Xbox Series X. 
                The Xbox Series S uses the same CPU and reduced GPU, memory, and internal storage and lacks an optical drive.

                PlayStation 5 (PS5) is a home video game console developed by Sony Interactive Entertainment. 
                Announced in 2019 as the successor to the PlayStation 4, the PS5 was released on November 12, 2020 in North America, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea,

                The platform launched in two variants: a base model with an Ultra HD Blu-ray-compatible optical disc drive, 
                and a Digital Edition lacking this drive, serving as a lower-cost variant for consumers who prefer to buy games through digital download.
                The PlayStation 5 has a solid-state drive customized for high-speed data streaming to enable significant improvements in graphical performance. 
                It has a custom AMD GPU capable of ray tracing, 4K resolution display at up to 120 frames per second, 3D audio effects, and backward compatibility with most PlayStation 4 and PlayStation VR games.
