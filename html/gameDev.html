        <p>The whole gaming era started by inventing a game which although it already had kind of a controller that can be compared with the newest ones, 
            nowadays is far away from the gaming we now. </p>

        <h2>The early history of video games</h2>
        <p> At the beginning video games were only created for research or for recreation. Many 2D strategic games in the early 1950's and 
            3D games as tic-tac-toe and Moon Landing in 1960's were only played by professors and students for testing them. 
            <br>
            At that time games were made by means of punch cards and they were played on computers like the IBM 1560.

            Only after the first video arcade games, 
            video game consoles like Magnavox Odyssey and  home computer games were invented in these years, 
            gaming became popular all over the whole world. 
            Today playing games is a form of entertainment and a part of modern culture over the whole world.</p>

        <h2>New Gaming Era</h2>

        <p>From 1960 numbers of programmers grew more and more, and so did the number of created games. 
            Meanwhile games also were sold commercially in catalogs.
            <br>
            After the costs of computers had fallen and more programming languages with more abilitys were invented, 
            a much better era of gaming began. Also by launching the commercial video game industriy in 1971 with coin-operated arcade games, 
            a big step to a better gaming future was made. From 1978 to 1982 arcade games were very common at the People.</p>
            <br>
            <p>During the 1980's gaming computers, early online gaming and handheld LCD games also were invented.</p>

        <br>

        <p>Unfortunately in 1983 this gaming era was badly affected by the video game crash.
           Many big game companys went bankrupt because of many factors.
           One of them was the saturation of markets in the number of game consoles and the many games invented at that time.
           <br>
           The revenue fell from 1983 to 1985 from $ 3.2 Billion to $ 100 Million which was a precentage drop of almost 97 percent.
           <br>
           <br>
           After the abrupt end of the crash a new generation of console video gaming started.
